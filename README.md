This is the collection of every single script that I wrote for my video game, H.A.R.V.E.S.T.E.R, which was made with Unity's 3D engine.
The scripts cameraShake, playerData/saveData, asteroidBelt, and loading mostly came from YouTube tutorials. I did not write the majority of the content in those scripts. 

Deprecated Scripts:
 - BASICScript (This was for older radar logic)
 - asteroidBelt (This was a GPU instancing experiment that I did not use in any released builds)

Scripts Fundamental to Gameplay:
- SenseOfFlight (A camera follow script for the player)
- ConsoleController (This runs nearly every background process relevant to the player.)
- GunController (Handles radar and laser aiming logic)
- PlayerController (Allows the player to move around)
- EnemyMovement (Handles all enemy movement/attack logic)
- Mineable (A script that is given to all targets that are locked by the player's radar. Gives them a random ore amount and health so that they can be mined. This has already been revamped several times, and I have an upcoming change planned where different asteroids will have different ore rarities)

H.A.R.V.E.S.T.E.R can be downloaded here as an early access game:
